Perfect for the competitor who doesn't want to be slowed down by his sidearm.The Express isn't really designed to be concealable. Because of the barrel compensator's design, this gun cannot be fitted with a suppressor. The Express is a racegun, not a combat monster, and its design reflects that: lots of satin-polished chrome steel, real wood grips, 125lpi checkering on the grips and frontstrap. The battery is loaded into the back of the gun, under the partial slide; the magazine is in the pistol grip. The wood grips feature a wrist support and ergonomic design. COT scope is attached to the frame, ahead of the slide. There are three adjustable weights under the barrel in front. Overall length of the gun is 36cm."

This handgun is popular with many police units for its \"staying power\"-that is to say, magazine capacity. Patrol officers commonly carry five twelve-round magazines of 11 mm AP, plus one up the spout; the banana clip is normally used by SWAT, entry teams, and military special-ops units."

Rather than employing a traditional cylinder, it uses Nova's patented \"Ammo Cassettes\". These are disposable cylinders composed of superstrong composite ceramics preloaded with seven .338 Nova cartridges. To reload, one simply drops out the empty cassette and slaps in a fresh one, thus doing away with clumsy reloading of individual rounds.The Citygun is packed with modern features, sporting a nonreflective matte black finish, a octagonal barrel which has an underbarrel universal scope-mount, an adjustable trigger, and twin triple-porting on the barrel which serves as a sophisticated muzzle compensator. The most striking feature is the weapon's layout-the cylinder has been positioned in front of the trigger group, creating a straight-line barrel-arm sight picture, and giving the gun an almost autopistol look! Nova also includes two spare ammo cassettes with every Citygun. Durable, reliable, and capable of placing seven high-velocity slugs in a two-inch pattern as fast as you can pull the trigger, the Citygun is indisputably the most advanced wheelgun on the market today."

Compact and thin, it produces no unsightly bulge in your designer suit when you're out escorting your employer. For further compactness a smaller magazine can be fitted (15 rounds) and the barrel shroud removed. This has the effect of lowering concealability to a large pocket: rating P (how large a pocket, the referee can decide)"

After detailed discussion with such units as GSG-9, the SAS, GIGN and Corporate strike teams like Dieter Kaufmann's Taktischekampf Einheit O, H&K produced a caseless 12mm laser- or smartchipped assault carbine. Slightly longer than the MP5, the MPK 2020 is compact enough to be carried in a thigh or long shoulder holster. Its 60-round magazine is deemed large enough for an initial attack without having to worry about reloading. Uncommon outside of Europe, this weapon is now a mainstay of anti-terrorist and special forces units in the EuroTheater\r"

Unfortunately, the military was not interested. When the Collapse came, Pancor was one of the companies destroyed by it The weapon (except for a few hundred owned by police, special-ops units, and survivalists) disappeared. When Meta Corporation was formed in 2012, one of the techs from Pancor (who had been deployed to SouthAm with other Meta personnel) reapplied for a patent. The patent was approved, and the Warhammer, an improved version of the Jackhammer, was released in 2016.The Warhammer sports a larger mag capacity, more efficient cerametal barrel, and optional smartchipping. These improvements are complemented by a wide range of ammunition types, giving the weapon impressive tactical versatility."

It also has an integral laser sight, which uses a diffraction scanner to draw a circle of bright red light equivalent to the pattern size at the impact point. For grenade and slug use, the laser may be tightened down to a narrow beam. The beam is also adjustable for different loads and barrel chokes. The gun fires single shots."

Two things are readily apparent when you first pick up this weapon. The first is the lack of interfacing for the shooter. This weapon is designed for military forces in the Third World who don't fit their soldiers with chips and plugs. Second is the old-fashioned configuration in an age where bullpups are the style. Side-folding stock and a 1.2x optical sight are standard options on the weapon. Because of the large numbers of these guns exported out of the Hong Kong trade zone, and their very low cost, the M-9 has become a common sight in the Third World and on the streets."

This is an advanced weapon firing a caseless 5.56mm round.It has seen limited service in special contingents of the U.S. Armed Forces and EC Defense Forces. IEC is the only corporation using this weapon in significant numbers. Refinements to the M-95A\/CG-13A series for improved military applications and release as the A4\/13B model include a tougher body, modular sight system, improved heat dispersal system and true magazines instead of the old disposable box pour-in system. Magazines for the A4 resemble the old G-11 boxes, but instead of merely storing ammo, the entire box slides into the receiver over the barrel. It makes for a little more susceptibility to contamination from dirt, but it also makes reloading easier and quicker under combat situations. The magazines are high-impact plastic and disposable. The modular sight system allows quick changing from telescopic to powered optical to laser sights without tools."

Through the use of advanced sensor technology, the shell homes in on the weapon's laser designator. The designator's integral range-finding computer determines such factors as wind speed\/direction, distance to target, etc., then vectors the shell toward the intended target. lowlite and infrared capabilities are built in. The incredible stopping power (and long range) of the Gyro has earned it the nickname \"Zeus' lightning\" among police and Max-Tac snipers."

Although the adoption of the 15mm BMG round (to replace the antique .50 cal) in the mid-1980s was never fully implemented (except in Europe), there were a number of weapons developed to jump on the 15mm bandwagon. The Collapse brought down most of these developers. A few years later, the Aldecaldos came across an old factory while salvaging back east. Hundreds of examples of 15mm BMG weapons had been tested or designed there, and all the tools and equipment were present to manufacture them- so the Aldecaldos did. Now most nomads use the 15mm BMG for anti-vehicle and sniping work.The media have taken to calling them Nomad Long Rifles, or even Kentucky Rifles. These weapons are huge and heavy, but when emplaced on a hill, they allow combat at a distance-something Nomads prefer. The most common version includes a scope mount with a 10x optical scope and lowlight, muzzle brake, flash hider, solenoid trigger, bipod, and custom furniture, and can be disassembled into three component parts (stock, action, barrel)."

        "Description": "Royal Enfield Ordnance Liquid Propellant Assault Rifle LPA1 is a twin-magazine, liquid-propellant, variable-velocity assault rifle. Designed as a multi-role small arms weapon system, it is now entering limited test service with the BCF. The LPA 1 is laid out in the traditional bullpup configuration with the liquid propellant stored in a self-sealing armored cassette in the butt The twin helical magazines are situated on either side of the receiver.Each magazine holds 45 rounds, giving the rifle an immense 90-round ammo supply. With dual magazines it is possible to carry mixed ammo types. The LPA1 can use most ammo options and can support rifle-fired grenades with a small muzzle modification. The rifle comes with three velocity settings, which can be selected either manually or by neural interface for smartchipped versions. The settings are 1) Low-riot\/2D6+ 1, 2) Medium-urban\/4D6, and 3) High-full combat\/6D6. Because of the high recoil on full velocity, a hydro-pneumatic recoil damper was built into the rifle. The liquid propellant (a derivative of ESA shuttle fuel) is injected into the breech under computer control. The amount injected depends on the velocity setting and range of the target This information comes from the integral Marconi SUSAT cyberoptic sight situated on top of the receiver.\r"
